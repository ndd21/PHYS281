# Exercises

Here are a selection of exercises covering various aspects of the course material. Their aim is to
make you think about how to solve a problem using code. These are not assessed, but you are
encouraged to try these out as the best way to learn to code is to do!

In several cases there are already exist functions, e.g., in NumPy, for performing some of these
exercise problems. While generally you should use existing functions from well maintained libraries
(they will be very well tested and robust), here (unless asked to use an appropriate library) the
aim is for you to think about how you would code up the function yourself.

## Python basics

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Open a Python/IPython terminal and declare two variables as @(floating point numbers). Add the
    two variables and store the output as a new variable. Print out the new variable value to the
    screen.

??? info "Solution"
    ```console
    $ ipython
    ```

    ```python
    >>> x = 1.2774392  # variable containing a floating point number
    >>> y = -3.4374323  # another variable containing a floating point number
    >>> z = x + y  # add the two variables and store result in z
    >>> print(z)  # print the result z to the screen
    ```

!!! question "Part 2"
    Print out the resulting variable to 3 decimal places.

??? info "Solution"
    Several options exist, e.g.,

    ```python
    >>> print("{0:.3f}".format(z))
    ```

    or

    ```python
    >>> print(f"{z:.3f}")
    ```

    or

    ```python
    >>> print("%.3f" % z)
    ```

!!! question "Part 3"
    Perform the same task, but this time write the code in a text file saved with the `.py`
    extension. Run the code in VS Code and also from the @(command line).

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question
    In a Python/IPython terminal, or in a script, import an appropriate library to calculate the
    sine of a list of angles that are given in degrees.

??? info "Solution"
    A method using the [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) library is:

    ```
    import math

    # make a list of angles (assumed to be in degrees)
    angles = [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180]

    sines = []
    # loop over angles
    for angle in angles:
        rad = math.radians(angle)  # convert angle to radians
        # rad = angle * math.pi / 180  # an alternative
        sines.append(math.sin(rad))  # calculate sine an append to list
    ```

    A different method using the [`NumPy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) library is:

    ```
    import numpy as np

    rads = np.deg2rad(angles)  # convert angles to radians
    sines = np.sin(rads)
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Given a list of numbers, without using the built-in
    [`max()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max) method, find the maximum value
    in the list. Try two different ways of looping through the list values.

??? info "Solution"
    Two different options are:

    ```python
    x = [-2, 3, 6, -5, 7, 8, 12, -9]

    maximum = x[0]  # use first value as initial comparitor
    for v in x[1:]:
        if v > maximum:
            maximum = v  # update comparitor
    ```

    or (using the [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range) and
    [`len()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) functions):

    ```python
    maximum = x[0]
    for i in range(1, len(x)):
        if x[i] > maximum:
            maximum = x[i]
    ```

!!! question "Part 2"
    Given two equal length lists of numbers, create a new list containing the sum of the pairs of
    values from those lists. Try two different methods of doing this.

??? info "Solution"
    Two different options are:

    ```python
    x = [-2, 3, 6, -5, 7, 8, 12, -9]
    y = [0, 12, -5, 2, 8, -8, 11, 2]

    z = []
    for i in range(len(x)):
        z.append(x[i] + y[i])
    ```

    or (using the [`zip()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) function):

    ```python
    z = []
    for vx, vy in zip(x, y):
        z.append(vx + vy)
    ```

!!! question "Part 3"
    Given two equal length lists of numbers, add the numbers from the first list onto the values in
    the second list (do not create a new list).

??? info "Solution"
    Using the [`enumerate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) function
    you can do:

    ```python
    x = [-2, 3, 6, -5, 7, 8, 12, -9]
    y = [0, 12, -5, 2, 8, -8, 11, 2]

    for i, v in enumerate(x):
        y[i] += v
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Use list comprehension to generate a list containing the square root of all integers between 1
    and 50.

??? info "Solution"

    ```python
    import math

    sqroots = [math.sqrt(x) for x in range(1, 51)]
    ```

!!! question "Part 2"
    Now use list comprehension to generate the square roots of only even numbers.

??? info "Solution"

    ```python
    import math

    sqroots = [math.sqrt(x) for x in range(1, 51) if x % 2 == 0]
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question
    Given a dictionary containing the following information

    ```python
    personaldata = {
        "firstname": "Sammy",
        "lastname": "Scissors",
        "housenumber": 2,
        "streetname": "Long Lane",
        "city": "Lancaster",
        "postcode": "LA1 8TF"
    }
    ```

    construct a single format string that will allow the address to be output in the form:

    ```
    Sammy Scissors
    2 Long Lane
    Lancaster
    LA1 8TF
    ```

??? info "Solution"
    A possible solution is

    ```python
    addressstring = (
        "{firstname} {lastname}\n"
        "{housenumber} {streetname}\n"
        "{city}\n"
        "{postcode}\n"
    )

    print(addressstring.format(**personaldata))
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Create an 3x4 (3 rows, 4 columns) array using a list of lists, where each value in the array is
    initialised to be 1.

??? info "Solution"
    The best way is to use list comprehension, e.g.,:

    ```python
    x = [[1 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(3)]
    ```

!!! question "Part 2"
    Set the corner values of the array to be zero.

??? info "Solution"

    ```python
    x[0][0] = 0
    x[-1][0] = 0
    x[0][-1] = 0
    x[-1][-1] = 0
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Create a 2D 3x3 matrix of numbers (using lists). Loop over the rows in the matrix and print out
    the sum of each row.

??? info "Solution"

    ```python
    x = [[0.1, 0.5, 1.2], [-2.3, 4.5, 0.3], [5.7, -0.3, 1.4]]

    # loop over each row
    for row in x:
        print(sum(row))
    ```

!!! question "Part 2"
    Now loop over the columns and print out the products of each column.

??? info "Solution"

    ```python
    # loop over each column
    for i in range(len(x)):
        # column has to be explicitly extracted
        column = [row[i] for row in x]

        product = 1.0
        for cv in colmn:
            product *= cv

        print(product)
    ```

    Note that this is easier with NumPy arrays, for which the rows and column can be transposed, e.g.:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    y = np.array(x)

    for row in y:
        print(np.sum(row))

    for col in y.T:  # transpose of y
        print(np.prod(col))
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter () }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Given the following dictionary:

    ```python
    charge = {
        "electron": -1,
        "positron": 1,
        "proton": 1,
        "neutron": 0,
        "up": 2/3,
        "down": -1/3
    }
    ```

    get a list of the dictionary keys and a list of the dictionary values.

??? info "Solution"
    The lists of keys and values can be extracted with:

    ```python
    keys = list(charge.keys())  # need to explicitly convert iterator to list
    values = list(charge.values())
    ```

!!! question "Part 2"
    Add a new particle and it's charge to the dictionary.

??? info "Solution"

    ```python
    charge["strange"] = -1/3
    ```

!!! question "Part 2"
    Find the number of positively charges particles in the dictionary and get a list of their
    names.

??? info "Solution"
    One option is:

    ```python
    npos = 0  # counter for positive particles
    positive = []  # list of positive particles
    for particle, c in charge.items():
        if c > 0:
            npos += 1
            positive.append(particle)
    ```

    Another method, using list comprehension, is:

    ```python
    positive = [c for c in charge.values() if c > 0]
    npos = len(positive)
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Create a dictionary with three keys `"a"`, `"b"` and `"c"`, where each key value is an empty list.

??? info "Solution"
    ```python
    data = {"a": [], "b": [], "c": []}
    # alternative
    # data = dict(a=[], b=[], c=[])
    ```

!!! question "Part 2"
    Add another key, `"d"`, into the dictionary that is also an empty list.

??? info "Solution"
    ```
    data["d"] = []
    ```

!!! question "Part 3"
    For each string in the list:

    ```python
    alpha = ["aadb", "bbcd", "aaaa", "bccc", "dddd", "cbcb", "daca"]
    ```

    append the numbers of each letter to the appropriate list in the dictionary.

??? note "Solution"
    ```python
    # loop over the list
    for a in alpha:
        # loop over each letter in the dictionary
        for letter in data:
            # count number of letters in each string
            numlet = a.count(letter)

            # append to list in dictionary
            data[letter].append(numlet)
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question
    Suppose you have a set of files containing the results of multiple consecutive
    experiments/simulations. To distinguish the files each file name is suffixed by an integer with
    preceding zeros, such the the number is always 3 digits long (assuming no more than 1000 files
    exist), e.g.,:

    ```
    experimental_results_000.txt
    experimental_results_001.txt
    ...
    experimental_results_258.txt
    experimental_results_259.txt
    ```

    Assuming you know how many files you have and the file name format, how might you loop over all
    the files to read them in?

??? info "Solution"
    A possible solution is:

    ```python
    N = 260  # total number of files

    basename = "experimental_results_{0:03d}.txt"

    # loop over files and read in results
    results = []
    for i in range(N):
        thisfile = basename.format(i)

        # read in the results in some form
        with open(thisfile, "r") as fp:
            results.append(fp.read())
    ```

## Python functions

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question
    In a Python file, write a function that asks the user to input a date in the format
    "YYYY-MM-DD" and then prints out the day of the week (see the Python
    [`datetime`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp) library). In another Python
    script, or Python/IPython terminal, import the function that you have written and run it.

??? info "Solution"
    Create a Python (called, say, `weekday.py`) file containing:

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime

    def getweekday():
        # ask user for input
        datestr = input("Input a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD: ")

        # split string into parts
        year, month, day = datestr.split("-")

        # convert into datetime object
        d = datetime(int(year), int(month), int(day))

        # get the day of the week
        weekday = d.strftime("%A")

        # output day of the week
        print(f"The date {datestr} was on a {weekday}")
    ```

    You may want to add a check that the date in is the correct format. This function could then be
    used with:

    ```console
    $ ipython
    ```

    ```python
    >>> from weekday import getweekday
    >>> getweekday()  # run the function
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Write a function that takes in a list of numbers as an argument and returns their
    [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean).

??? info "Answer"
    An example of how to do this is:

    ```python
    def mean(values):
        s = 0.0  # variable to hold sum of values
        for value in values:
            s += value

        # return the mean
        return s / len(values)
    ```

    You could add some checking that values is indeed a list. You could also use the built-in
    Python [`sum()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum) function rather
    than using the for loop.

!!! question "Part 2"
    Write a function that takes in a list of numbers as an argument and returns their [standard
    deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation). Can the function from Part 1 be
    re-used?

??? info "Solution"
    An example of how to do this is:

    ```python
    def std(values):
        # get the mean of the values (re-use the previous function)
        mu = mean(values)
        
        # get the variance (re-use mean function again)
        var = mean([(x - mu)**2 for x in values])

        # return the standard deviation
        return var ** 0.5
    ```

!!! question "Part 3"
    Write a function that that takes in list of numbers as an argument and returns the median.

??? info "Solution"
    An example of how to do this is:

    ```python
    def median(values):
        # use the built-in sorted function to sort the values in ascending order
        sortvals = sorted(values)

        # get the halfway index
        half = int(len(values) / 2)
        
        # check if values contains an odd or even number of values
        if len(values) % 2 == 0:
            # an even number, so return average of middle two numbers
            return (values[half - 1] + values[half]) / 2
        else:
            # an odd number, so return middle number
            return values[half]
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question
    Write a function that:
    
     * takes in a list of strings as an argument,
     * finds the unique strings,
     * counts the number of occurrences of each of those unique strings in the list
     * returns those number counts in a dictionary keyed by the unique string values.

    E.g.,

    ```python
    >>> animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat', 'horse']
    >>> counts = count_occurrences(animals)
    >>> print(counts)
    {'cat': 2, 'dog': 3, 'horse': 1}
    ```

??? info "Solution"
    A way of doing this is:

    ```python
    def count_occurrences(values):
        # get unique strings by converting to a set
        unique = set(values)

        # create empty dictionary for counts
        counts = {}

        # loop over unique strings and count occurrences
        for word in unique:
            count = 0
            for w in values:
                if w == word:
                    count += 1

            # short method (use count method of a list)
            #counts[word] = values.count(word)

        return counts
    ```

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Write a function that takes in a list as an argument and returns a new list containing the square of
    every $n$th index (starting at the 0 index), where $n$ is another argument to the function with a
    default value of 2.

    E.g.,

    ```python
    >>> values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    >>> sq = square_index(values)
    >>> print(sq)
    [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
    ```

??? info "Solution"
    A way of doing this is:

    ```python
    def square_index(values, step=2):
        squ = []

        # loop over list in steps of "step"
        for i in range(0, len(values), step):
            squ.append(values[i] ** 2)

        return squ

        # short method (using slice notation instead)
        #return [x ** 2 for x in values[::step]]
    ```

    You may want to include checks that `values` is a list and that `step` is an integer.


!!! question "Part 1"
    Alter the function so that it takes in another argument, `reverse`, which defaults to `False`, but
    if `True` makes the function return the list in reverse order.

??? info "Solution"
    A way of doing this is:

    ```python
    def square_index(values, step=2, reverse=False):
        squ = []

        # get indices to return
        if reverse:
            idxs = range(len(values), 0, -step)
        else:
            idxs = range(0, len(values), step)

        # loop over list in steps of "step"
        for i in idxs:
            squ.append(values[i] ** 2)

        return squ
    ```

    The [`slice()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice) function could also be
    used rather than the [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range)
    function.

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Given a square 2D matrix, e.g.,:

    ```python
    M = [[1.5, 2.1, 3.6, 4.1], [-0.2, 6.1, 7.2, -5.0], [3.4, 10.1, 1.7, 12.9], [-13.0, 1.3, -2.4, 0.8]]
    ```

    write a function that takes in the matrix as an argument and returns it's
    [diagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_diagonal) elements as a list.

??? info "Solution"
    ```python
    def diag(M):
        """

        for i in range(len(M)):
            de.append(M[i][i])

        return de
    ```

    You may want to include tests that the matrix is two-dimensional and square.

!!! question "Part 2"
    Write a function to calculate the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of
    the matrix.
    
    Hint: The built-in Python
    [`itertools`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#module-itertools) module can
    calculate permutations. You will also need to calculate the [_signature_ (or
    parity)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_a_permutation) of the permutation.

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Write a function to "bin" a list of numbers, i.e., count how many of the numbers are in each of
    a set of intervals over the full range (e.g., the bin sizes in a
    [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)). The function arguments should be
    the list of numbers, the number of bins (defaulting to 10), and the lower and upper bin edges
    (if not given by the user these should default to use the smallest and largest number in the
    input list, respectively).

!!! question "Part 1"
    Write a function that returns a [boxcar function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcar_function) of the form:

     C, & \text{if } a \leq x \leq b  \\
     0, & \text{otherwise},

## Reading/writing data

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    You have a file containing the student grades for 3 different exercises. The file consists of
    a header line (denoted by starting with a `#`), followed by lines containing four values
    separated by commas ("comma separated values", or CSV):

    1. unique student ID
    2. grade for exercise 1 (mark out of 20)
    3. grade for exercise 2 (mark out of 30)
    4. grade for exercise 3 (mark out of 40)

    E.g.,:

    ```
    # Student ID, Exercise 1 (20), Exercise 2 (30), Exercise 3 (40)
    1234, 12, 23, 29
    1235, 9, 28, 31
    1236, 13, 8, 25
    ```

    Read in the file and then calculate each student's total mark (as a percentage rounded to the
    nearest integer), where the three exercises are weighted at 25%, 25% and 50%, respectively. You
    can used a library such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) to read in the
    data.

??? note "Solution"
    A possible way _without_ using, e.g., NumPy

    ```python
    resfile = "results.csv"  # the results file

    maxmarks = [20, 30, 40]  # maximum marks for each exercise
    weights = [0.25, 0.25, 0.50]  # fractional weights for each exercise

    # read in results
    grades = {}
    with open(resfile, "r") as fp:
        for line in fp.readlines():
            # ignore header lines starting with a #
            if line[0] != "#":
                # split the line on commas
                splitline = line.split(",")

                # get student ID (string trailing whitespace)
                studentid = splitline[0].strip()

                # get grades (converting to integers)
                grades[studentid] = [int(grade.strip()) for grade in splitline[1:]]

    # calculate final weighted grades
    finalgrades = {}
    for studentid in grades:
        finalgrade = 0.0
        for i in range(len(maxmarks)):
            finalgrade += weights[i] * (grades[studentid][i] / maxmarks[i])

        finalgrades[studentid] = round(finalgrade * 100)  # convert to percentage
    ```

    This can be more compact using NumPy's
    [`loadtxt()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html) function or
    the more complete
    [`genfromtxt()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html)
    function, e.g.,:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    resfile = "results.csv"  # the results file

    maxmarks = [20, 30, 40]  # maximum marks for each exercise
    weights = [0.25, 0.25, 0.50]  # fractional weights for each exercise
    
    results = np.loadtxt(
        resfile,
        comments="#",  # ignore header (could also use skiprows=1)
        delimiter=",",  # comma separated values
    )

    # calculate final weighted grades
    gradevalues = np.round(
        100 * sum(weights[i] * results[:,i+1] / maxmarks[i] for i in range(len(weights)))
    )

    for i in range(len(results)):
        studentid = str(results[i, 0])  # convert ID to string
        finalgrades[studentid] = gradevalues[i]
    ```

    Another option would be to use the
    [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)
    [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html)
    function.

!!! question "Part 2"
    Write the results to a new CSV file with the total grade as a new fifth column.

??? info "Solution"
    There are again multiple ways of doing this. E.g., using the NumPy [`savetxt()`] function
    (assuming we have the `results` and `finalgrades` as above):

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    # append final results onto the "results" array
    results = np.hstack((results, [grade for grade in finalgrades.items()]))

    outputfile = "final_results.csv"
    header = "np.Student ID, Exercise 1 (20), Exercise 2 (30), Exercise 3 (40), Final grade (%)"

    np.savetxt(outputfile, results, fmt="%d", delimiter=",", header=header)
    ```

                raise ValueError("Shape of E is not consistent with grid points")

            self.label = label
    ```

    Add a method to this class that saves the class itself as a
    [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) file (you can used the NumPy
    [`save()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.save.html) function with the
    `allow_pickle=True` option set). It should use the `label` attribute to construct the name of
    the save file (with appropriate extension added).

    Also add a [`classmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod) to
    read in a saved object.

    Create an instance of the object and try saving it at reading it back in.

!!! question "Part 2"
    Add a new method to the class that will return the electric field interpolated at any point
    within the grid. You may want to use the SciPy
    [`interp2d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html)

    This could be used by doing, e.g.,:

    ```python
    # create an empty survey
    survey = AstroSurvey()    

    # add some objects (first few Messier objects)
    survey.add_object("M1", 8.4)
    survey.add_object("M2", 6.3)
    survey.add_object("M3", 6.2)
    survey.add_object("M4", 5.9)
    ```

    You might note that this currently doesn't do much more than copying one dictionary into
    another, albeit with some additional type checking!

    dimmest = survey.dimmest()
    print(f"The dimmest object in the survey is {dimmest}")

    class should contain class attributes that define the [Stefan-Boltzmann
    constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_constant) and [Wien's
    displacement constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law). It should be
    initialised with a temperature (in Kelvin) and the body's radius including checks to make sure
    these are positive numbers.
    
    It should include two methods that:

    1. return the black body's [bolometic luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity#Luminosity_formulae),

### Exercise {{ counter() }}

!!! question "Part 1"
    Create a class to define `Square` objects. The class should be intialised using a tuple or list
    that contains four pairs (also tuples or lists) of $x$ and $y$ coordinates for the corners of
    the square, which should then be stored in th class. The class should contain a method to check
    that the input points define a valid square (i.e. all sides are the same length and all angles
    between sides are 90 degrees), which should be used during initialisation and an error raised
    if it fails the check.

!!! question "Part 2"
    Add methods to the class that return the area and perimeter of the square.

!!! question "Part 3"
    Add a method to the class that takes in a point, given by a tuple containing its $x$ and $y$
    coordinates, and returns `True` if the point is within the square and `False` if not.

!!! question "Part 4"
    Create a `Square` and then get a new `Square` based on the original, but rotated by 30 degrees
    about the first square's centre. Plot the two squares on the same figure.

    Hint: you may have already written code, or a method, in the class that rotates a square.

??? info "Solution"
    A possible class is:

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/exercises/square.py"
    ```

    Given this class two squares can be plotted with:

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    # first square
    s1 = Square([[4, 3], [4, 5], [6, 5], [6, 3]])
    
    # rotated square
    s2 = s1.rotate_square(np.deg2rad(30))

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    # plot s1 in blue and s2 in red
    for s, c in zip([s1, s2], ["b", "r"]):
        x = np.hstack((s.vertices[:, 0], s.vertices[0, 0]))
        y = np.hstack((s.vertices[:, 1], s.vertices[0, 1]))
        ax.plot(x, y, color=c)

    # make axes have an equal aspect ratio
    ax.set_aspect("equal")
    fig.tight_layout()

    fig.show()
    ```

    ![Plot of two squares](exercises/exercises_squares.png)

    A [`Rectangle`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.patches.Rectangle.html#matplotlib.patches.Rectangle)
    patch could be used instead if you work out the bottom left corner and the required rotation
    angle.
